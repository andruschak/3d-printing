# Adventures in 3d-printing
First foray into 3D Printing - sat on the sidelines for too long.

I figured it was time to give 3D printing a go. After researching a bunch of 3D printers I landed on the Anet A8 (Prusa i3 clone). Many may not agree (as there are many reports of them catching fire) but it ticked off a bunch of the criteria I was looking for:

- [x] Decent build plate size
- [x] Required assembly
- [x] Entry level price
- [x] Open source/community/hackable
- [x] Supports multi filament types
- [ ] Non-fire causing
- [ ] Enclosed
- [ ] Dual Extruder (possible nice to have?)


Huge list of resources for the A8:

Next steps
- [ ] Support structure mods
- [ ] Flash firmware to Marlin (Skynet 3D)
