# Adventures in 3d-printing
First foray into 3D Printing

I figured it was time to give 3D printing a go. After researching a bunch of 3D printers I landed on the Anet A8 (Prusa i3 clone).

### Printer Criteria:

- [x] Required assembly
- [x] Entry level price (<500$)
- [x] Decent build plate size (220x220x240mm)
- [x] Open source/community/hackable
- [x] Supports multi filament types

- [ ] Non-fire causing
- [ ] Enclosed
- [ ] Dual Extruder (possible nice to have?)

### Resources

- [ ] Flash firmware to Marlin (Skynet 3D)
